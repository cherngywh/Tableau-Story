# Tableau-Story

**Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report. <br>
provide answers to the following questions:**


*- How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?*<br>
*- By what percentage has total ridership grown?*<br>
*- How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?*<br>
*- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months (for whatever year of data you selected)?*<br>
*- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months (for whatever year of data you selected)?*<br>
*- What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)*<br>
*- What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)*<br>
*- What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)*<br>
*- What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)*<br>
*- What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?*<br>
*- How does the average trip duration change by age?*<br>
*- What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?*<br>
*- Which Bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection this year?*<br>
*- How variable is the utilization by bike ID?*<br>


**Additionally, it also contains following visualizations:**


*-A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.*<br>
*-A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.*


**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever, you must also:**


*Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence.*
